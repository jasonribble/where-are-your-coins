## Pre-requistes 

- Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electric cash system
- Let's pretend it's $0 per coin today.
- ~~What is money? Monetary Theory~~
- ~~Macro economics~~
- ~~Energy section conversation~~
- If we have extra time and exhausted technical questions, then we can talk big picture
- Legal disclaimer

## Objective

- To see what the underlying technical metahpor of Bitcoin.
When talking about bitcion, we use metaphor to make it more human meaningful.
- (Hidden agenda: Confuse you to incite curositity)

## Metaphors in Computer Science

In computer science, we talk in abstrations for simplicity.

This help us by allowing for additional complexity, but with a tradeoff.

What are some examples of this?

## Who has send & receieve bitcoin before?

- Can someone describe how I can send them bitcoin step-by-step?
  - Talk in human meaningful ways
- Where are your coins? 

## Quote from Mastering Bitcoin

"In bitcoin, there are no coins, no senders, no recipients, no balances, no accounts, and no addresses. All those things are constructed at a higher level for the benefit of the user, to make things easier to understand." - Ch 10, Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos


## So, what is cryptocurrency?

- crypto = hidden (Latinized Greek)
- cryptography = writing in secret characters
- cryptocurrency = hidden currency? 
- Very little encryption in bitcoin

## Core cryptography in bitcoin

- We'll focus on two forms of applied cryptography in bitcoin
- What is a core element of cryptography?

## Assemetry

- Easy to do one way
- Hard to reverse it
- What's an example of this? Non-technical answers are acceptable
- Why is assemestry important?

## Miners = Hashers
- What is a hash?
- What is Proof of Work?
- What is the purpose of mining?
  - Why do we need it?

## Miners = Hashers (continued)

“The purpose of mining is not the creation of new bitcoin. That’s the incentive system. Mining is the mechanism by which bitcoin’s security is decentralized.” - Mastering Bitcoin

## Wallets = Signers
- What are keys?
  - What is a public key?
  - What is a private key?
  - What is a bitcoin address?
- What are signatures?
